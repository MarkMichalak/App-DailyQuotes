    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>DailyQuotes (“we”, “our”, or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and store data when you use our mobile application DailyQuotes.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>

        <li><strong>Remote API:</strong> We fetch quotes from third-party APIs (e.g., quotable.io). We do not log or store any personally identifiable information from these calls.</li>
        <li><strong>No Analytics:</strong> We do not collect usage analytics, crash reports, or any tracking identifiers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Use of Data</h2>
    <p>Your favorites are saved so you can view them offline. No data is used for marketing or shared with advertisers.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use <a href="https://quotable.io">Quotable API</a> under its terms of service. Please review their policy for details on how they handle requests.</p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>We follow industry best practices to secure local data on your device. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>DailyQuotes is not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect information from them.</p>
